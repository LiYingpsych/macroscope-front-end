* move settings to side, always open on large screens. On settings change update data displays, this should only have to load the data displays that have changed as the search term itself hasnt been changed. Make sure fast consecutive requests load the most up to date settings 

* Make optional request parameters not optional - idea is that I should not be defaulting options and that the user should know what options are being used

* Change logo192 and logo512 to macroscope logos

* Calculate width of screen and pass to JSNetworkGraph so that the network renders in the middle of the screen

* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.

* Quick consecutive searches (ie one search followed by a second search before the first has finished) - second search doesn't show that it is loading and then results suddenly show

CHARTS
* Move data displays from index.tsx into respective files
* Add labels to axis
* Add tooltips
* Add all matches to frequency chart 

NICE TO HAVE
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Document .env
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?

TO ASK:
* What should "score" be called in synonym table?

#Jack
* setting -> search features
