CHARTS:
* Add labels to axis
* Add tooltips and information on highlight
* Add all matches to frequency chart
* Context change "hello" isnt working
* Add y axis zoom domain?

CHART LABELS:
* Frequency independent axis label unit?

TO DOCUMENT:
* .env file (REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=https://api.macroscope.tech REACT_APP_API_KEY=cNiI3wAUwlKX/tFJedwEWmIAk1RBT5y3IujdgUNq4rM= REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production)
* svgs github logo sourced from https://svgporn.com/

MAY TAKE SOME TIME:
* Add request response caching to quickly responde to recently run requests - this might have to be done in the api
* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.
* Add tests!!
* Clicking on data display title takes you to full page view in new tab
* Proper error catching when wordanalysis query string is faulty

SETTINGS:
* Settings with start and end year should be a range input slider
* Frequency should have options for --match-full-word --match-start --match-middle --match-end cli flags and display lines for each with differnet colours and a key
* Semantic drift should have options for --start-year --end-year --number-of-years-in-interval --number-of-closest-words

NICE TO HAVE:
* Search bar word autocomplete
* Make setting bar collapsable - make width adjustable?
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?
* Monetise with client side crypto mining (which is easily turned of or adjusted) and donations
* Create svg macroscope logo
* Data display order should be dependent on settings order

TO ASK:
* What should "score" be called in synonym table?
