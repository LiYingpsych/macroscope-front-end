CHARTS:
* Add colour to context network nodes
* Add labels to axis
* Add tooltips and information on highlight
* Add all matches to frequency chart
* Context change "hello" isnt working
* Add y axis zoom domain?

THOMAS MEETING
* Add to and bottom padding to line charts. Smallest value point is always on the x axis even if it isn't 0. Point should only be on x axis if it is 0.
* Increase max width of data display container

MAC PROBLEMS
* Zoom in settings dissapear (safari?)
* Possible mac problem - load synonym network, change similarity threshold setting, network rearranges then network request fullfils.

MAY TAKE SOME TIME:
* Add request response caching to quickly responde to recently run requests - this might have to be done in the api
* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.
* Add tests!!
* Proper error catching when wordanalysis query string is faulty

NICE TO HAVE:
* Search bar word autocomplete
* Make setting bar collapsable - make width adjustable?
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?
* Monetise with client side crypto mining (which is easily turned of or adjusted) and donations
* Create svg macroscope logo
* Data display order should be dependent on settings order
