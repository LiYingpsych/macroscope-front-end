* Make optional request parameters not optional - idea is that I should not be defaulting options and that the user should know what options are being used

* Change logo192 and logo512 to macroscope logos

* Calculate width of screen and pass to JSNetworkGraph so that the network renders in the middle of the screen

* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.

CHARTS
* Move data displays from index.tsx into respective files
* Add labels to axis
* Add tooltips
* Add all matches to frequency chart 

NICE TO HAVE
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Document .env
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?

TO ASK:
* What should "score" be called in synonym table?
