MAY TAKE SOME TIME:
* Add request response caching to quickly responde to recently run requests - this might have to be done in the api
* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.
* Add tests!!
* Proper error catching when wordanalysis query string is faulty
* Look into https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs graphing solution

NICE TO HAVE:
* Search bar word autocomplete
* Make setting bar collapsable - make width adjustable?
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?
* Monetise with client side crypto mining (which is easily turned of or adjusted) and donations
* Create svg macroscope logo
* Data display order should be dependent on settings order
