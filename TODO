* Quick consecutive searches (ie one search followed by a second search before the first has finished) - second search doesn't show that it is loading and then results suddenly show

* On settings change update data displays, this should only have to load the data displays that have changed as the search term itself hasnt been changed.
Make sure fast consecutive requests load the most up to date settings 

* Add request response caching to quickly responde to recently run requests

* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.

* Add tests!!

TO DOCUMENT
* .env file (REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=https://api.macroscope.tech REACT_APP_API_KEY=cNiI3wAUwlKX/tFJedwEWmIAk1RBT5y3IujdgUNq4rM= REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production)
* svgs sourced from https://svgporn.com/

CHARTS
* Calculate width of screen and pass to JSNetworkGraph so that the network renders in the middle of the screen
* Move data displays from index.tsx into respective files
* Add labels to axis
* Add tooltips
* Add all matches to frequency chart
* Context change "hello" isnt working

NICE TO HAVE
* Search bar word autocomplete
* Make setting bar collapsable - make width adjustable?
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Document .env
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?
* Monetise with client side crypto mining (which is easily turned of or adjusted) and donations
* Create svg macroscope logo
* clicking on data display title takes you to full page view in new tab
* proper error catching when wordanalysis query string is faulty

SETTINGS
* Settings with start and end year should be a range input slider
* Frequency should have options for --match-full-word --match-start --match-middle --match-end cli flags and display lines for each with differnet colours and a key
* Semantic drift should have options for --start-year --end-year --number-of-years-in-interval --number-of-closest-words

TO ASK:
* What should "score" be called in synonym table?

#Jack
* setting -> search features
