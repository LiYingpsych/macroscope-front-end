CHARTS:
* Calculate width of screen and pass to JSNetworkGraph so that the network renders in the middle of the screen
* Move data displays from index.tsx into respective files
* Add labels to axis
* Add tooltips and information on highlight
* Add all matches to frequency chart
* Context change "hello" isnt working

TO DOCUMENT:
* .env file (REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL=https://api.macroscope.tech REACT_APP_API_KEY=cNiI3wAUwlKX/tFJedwEWmIAk1RBT5y3IujdgUNq4rM= REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production)
* svgs github logo sourced from https://svgporn.com/

MAY TAKE SOME TIME:
* Add request response caching to quickly responde to recently run requests - this might have to be done in the api
* Fix settings performance - each change to settings does a complete rerender of all expansion panels which requires alot. Possible solution is to move settings into each data display expansion panel.
* Add tests!!
* Clicking on data display title takes you to full page view in new tab
* Proper error catching when wordanalysis query string is faulty

SETTINGS:
* Settings with start and end year should be a range input slider
* Frequency should have options for --match-full-word --match-start --match-middle --match-end cli flags and display lines for each with differnet colours and a key
* Semantic drift should have options for --start-year --end-year --number-of-years-in-interval --number-of-closest-words

NICE TO HAVE:
* Search bar word autocomplete
* Make setting bar collapsable - make width adjustable?
* Create .d.ts files for api request parameter and response interfaces? 
* Add /cooccurrence data display and settings
* Add https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized to tables?
* Monetise with client side crypto mining (which is easily turned of or adjusted) and donations
* Create svg macroscope logo

TO ASK:
* What should "score" be called in synonym table?

FEEDBACK:
* setting -> search features

THOMAS COMMENTS
1.  Place "Frequency" and "Sentiment" settings at the top by default.
    Default them to enabled.

2.  Set "automaticRearrangeAfterDropNode: true" for network graphs. 
    For some reason, this option doesn't work when "nodeHighlightBehavior: true" - submit this as an issue to "react-d3-graph", or see if this is expected behaviour

3.  This item in the email needs discussion with Thomas.

3.b Add setting input tooltips - or explain each input in the manual

5.  Can we get more year axis ticks on sentiment and frequency.  Perhaps at 25 year intervals.

6.  "Sentiment" setting should consist of 3 switches (Valence, Arousal, Concreteness), each of which display a different coloured line on the graph.
    What does Thomas mean by "Technically they arenâ€™t all sentiment, which is something we needed to change from before".
    If they aren't related to sentiment then they shouldn't be under that setting
